This is my personal site. It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator, and it's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), a template for a minimal Jekyll site.


## Usage

I am using GitHub Pages's built-in Jekyll functionality, which is well documented [in GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages).  This includes [a good article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) on rendering a Jekyll site locally. Note that I had no issues getting this working on Windows following the [Installation via RubyInstaller](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/#installation-via-rubyinstaller) instructions.
